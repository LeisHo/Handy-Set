# HANDYSET — Project Conventions

A mobile-first three.js scene rendering a single rigged hand (offshoot of
`J:\CLAUDE\PROJECTS\HANDY DANDIES`, reusing its rigged hand asset and pose/
camera/lighting/toon-shading systems) that rotates in response to the
phone's own gyroscope/accelerometer tilt. On desktop, cursor distance/angle
from the viewport center stands in for phone tilt. Deployed/tested on
Vercel. See `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.txt` for full scope and
`docs/CODE_SUMMARY.txt` for architecture.

The dev panel follows the workspace-wide standard in the parent
`CLAUDE.md` §12, built from the ACTUAL `.claude/TEMPLATE_DEV_PANEL.html`
engine (`src/devpanel/devPanel.js` is that file's own `<script>` block,
copied verbatim — not a divergent hand-rolled copy the way HANDY DANDIES'
own devPanel.js is). Only extend `devPanel.js` itself for a genuinely
generic engine capability it doesn't have yet; add project settings via
`src/main.js`'s own `render*Group()` functions, called from
`window.renderHandysetDevGroups` (wired into the template's
`ensureDevPanelBuilt()` splice point).

## File map

- `index.html` — import map (three.js via CDN, matching HANDY DANDIES'
  pinned version), canvas, loading/motion-permission UI, and the dev
  panel's body markup (copied verbatim from the template). Script load
  order matters: `src/main.js` (a module, always deferred) loads BEFORE
  `src/devpanel/devPanel.js` (`defer` attribute added so it participates
  in the same deferred-execution queue) — `main.js` must define
  `window.renderHandysetDevGroups` before `devPanel.js`'s own eager
  `ensureDevPanelBuilt()` call (auto-open on localhost/dev-mode) runs, or
  that call finds nothing to render. See index.html's own comment.
- `src/main.js` — all real logic: bind-pose measurement, finger/wrist
  posing (ported verbatim from HANDY DANDIES' `applyCurlToSkeleton`/
  `rotateOnTrueWorldAxis`), toon material + gradient map, wrist-crop
  clipping plane, camera/lighting preset system, Phone Tilt mechanic
  (device orientation + desktop mouse fallback, both reduced to the same
  normalized tilt-vector abstraction), Tween playback, and every dev-panel
  group's render/wire functions.
- `src/style.css` — page styles + the template's own dev-panel CSS,
  copied verbatim (see its own header comment for the exact source).
- `src/devpanel/devPanel.js` — the template's engine `<script>` block,
  copied verbatim except for one inserted line at the documented splice
  point inside `ensureDevPanelBuilt()`.
- `data/processed/HAND3D/Hand2.glb` — the rigged hand asset, already
  present from before this project's reset (same asset HANDY DANDIES
  uses).
- `api/save-settings.js` — Vercel serverless function backing the dev
  panel's git-tracked Save (§12l upgrade), ported from HANDY DANDIES' own.
  Wired from `main.js`'s own `wireRemoteSaveButtons()`/
  `loadRemoteSettingsOnStartup()` — deliberately NOT wired inside
  `devpanel/devPanel.js` itself (kept a verbatim copy); instead attaches
  its own extra click listeners to the existing SYNC buttons and polls
  for devPanel.js's globals to become available. Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN`/
  `DEV_PANEL_SAVE_SECRET` set on this project's own Vercel project — see
  README.md's own setup section.

## Known simplifications vs. HANDY DANDIES

**Corrected 2026-09-21** — the original version of this section documented
several SILENT scope cuts (a plain select+3-buttons instead of the real
list-picker, generic group/setting names instead of HANDY DANDIES' actual
current ones) that should have been surfaced and asked about instead of
disclosed after the fact — see the parent workspace `CLAUDE.md` §0a's new
"Full fidelity or ask" subsection, added the same day this was caught. The
list-picker (Save/Overwrite/Use/Rename/Delete/+Group, Export/Import on
Saved Poses, a real scrollable list) and exact group/setting names/
groupings (cross-checked against `HANDY DANDIES/data/processed/dev-panel-
settings.json`'s actual saved `order`/`textOverrides` — NOT just the base
DEV_GROUPS code, which the LIVE panel had already been reorganized away
from) are now ported properly. The full Field Layout group (rows/cols/
spacing/offsets/hide) is also now ported, defaulted to 1x1 (a single
centered hand) per direct instruction, ready for more hands later.

Genuine remaining gaps — these need real new subsystems, not just
wiring, and are still open:

- **Reactive Arm Length** (Reactive On/Off, Min/Max Crop %, a distance→crop
  curve editor, `armLengthRange`/`armLengthCurve`) — `updateWristCrop()`
  still only does the simplified fixed-multiple-of-hand-length version.
- **Responsive Wrist Splay** (Master On/Off, stagger, default, reactive
  on/off, Min/Max range, a distance→splay curve editor) — not built at
  all yet.
- **Toon rim-lighting** (Texture Influence, Toon Texture Tint, Rim
  Intensity/Power/Color) — needs HANDY DANDIES' actual `onBeforeCompile`
  GLSL patch (`createToonMaterial()`, that project's main.js), not
  reconstructed from scratch. `makeGradientTexture()`'s plain step-gradient
  stays as the base, this adds on top of it.
- **Outline: Use OutlinePass toggle + Hull-shader alternative** (Hull
  Outline Thickness) — this project only ever built the OutlinePass
  technique; HANDY DANDIES lets you switch between 2.
- **Camera Max Extents** only clamps zoom distance (`controls.maxDistance`)
  — HANDY DANDIES' own `enforceCameraPanExtent()` also clamps the PAN
  target to a bounding sphere every frame; not ported.
- **Wrist bend/splay/rotation axis choices** in `applyWristPoseToSkeleton()`
  were reconstructed (matching the finger system's own
  `rotateOnTrueWorldAxis` mechanism) rather than copied from HANDY
  DANDIES' real function body — still worth a visual sanity check.
- **Shoulder/elbow/forearm pose fields** (`shoulderRaise`, `elbowBend`,
  etc.) in the imported pose JSON are not wired to any bone — every
  provided pose has them at 0, and the wrist crop hides that region
  regardless.
- **Multi-hand camera framing**: `getHandCenterWorld()`/camera presets
  target the PRIMARY hand (`hands[0]`) only — reasonable for the current
  1x1 default, but once more hands are added the camera won't automatically
  frame the whole field; needs its own follow-up.

## Gotchas

- **`addRow()` (main.js) must set `ctrl.tab = 'desktop'` on every control**,
  or `buildUniformControlRow()` (devPanel.js) silently attaches the wrong
  per-row device checkbox ("Independent from Desktop" instead of "Show in
  Mobile/Landscape") since it checks `ctrl.tab === 'desktop'` explicitly
  with no sensible default for a missing field. Missed on the first pass
  across every control literal in every `render*Group()` function — fixed
  centrally in `addRow()` itself (the one choke point every control passes
  through) rather than touching ~150 individual control objects.
- **The group-level cascade checkbox (`buildGroupCascadeCheckbox()` in
  devPanel.js) ships from `TEMPLATE_DEV_PANEL.html` with
  `cb.style.display = 'none'` hardcoded at creation, and nothing anywhere
  in that ~5700-line file ever sets it back to visible** (confirmed by
  exhaustive grep) — a real latent bug in the template file itself, not a
  simplification made here. Fixed locally by removing that line (see the
  function's own comment). Worth folding back into
  `.claude/TEMPLATE_DEV_PANEL.html` itself per its own MAINTENANCE note,
  since every other project built from this template has the same bug.
- **This sandbox's local static server can intermittently fail to fully
  deliver `devPanel.js`** (`200 OK` but also `net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET`
  on the same request, per `read_network_requests`) — when the dev panel
  loads with every group showing 0 children and devPanel.js's own globals
  never become available, this is very likely the cause, not a real code
  regression. Same documented gotcha as HANDY DANDIES' own `main.js` size
  issue, just hitting `devPanel.js` here (4557 lines) instead. Retry the
  navigation before assuming a just-made change broke something.

- **The `html.dev-mode` class comes from a tiny early `<head>` script**
  (before `<link rel="stylesheet">`), not from `devPanel.js` itself —
  missing it (an early mistake this session made when first assembling
  `index.html`) leaves the DEV toggle button and panel permanently
  `display:none` even though `devPanel.js` itself loads and runs fine.
  Copy it from `TEMPLATE_DEV_PANEL.html` lines 178-186 verbatim if ever
  rebuilding `index.html` from scratch.
- **Script tag order/defer matters** — see the File Map note above.
- **`window.innerWidth`/`innerHeight` can read 0 at script-parse time in
  this sandbox** (same documented HANDY DANDIES gotcha) — `animate()`
  self-heals every frame by comparing `renderer.getSize()` against the
  live window size, same fix shape as that project's own.
- **Bump `?v=` on `src/main.js`/`devpanel/devPanel.js` in `index.html`
  when their content changes** — this static server can serve a stale
  cached copy otherwise (same documented HANDY DANDIES gotcha; caused
  real confusion this session before being caught).
- **A stack-overflow error** (`RangeError: Maximum call stack size
  exceeded`, inside `devPanel.js`'s own dynamicDevice mirroring code,
  `onDevTargetControlEdited`) was observed once during this session's own
  live verification, after clicking a Debug-group checkbox. Not yet
  root-caused or reproduced deliberately — the panel kept working
  afterward (checkbox toggled correctly, rendering unaffected), so it
  wasn't fatal, but flag it if it recurs.
- **Real device sensor data (accelerometer/gyroscope/compass) could not be
  verified in this session** — no physical device was available; only the
  gating logic (touch-device detection, iOS permission-request flow,
  Desktop-silence) was verified to run without crashing.
